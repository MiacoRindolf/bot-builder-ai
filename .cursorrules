# Cursor Rules - Updated from Bot Builder AI Session Learnings

## Git Command Best Practices
- AVOID complex git commands that hang in PowerShell: `git status --porcelain`, `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`, `git add -A`
- When git commands hang, try the next logical step directly (e.g., if checking status hangs, try `git commit` directly)
- Trust git output - "working tree clean means everything is committed
- Use simple commands: `git status`, `git commit`, `git push`
- Don't get stuck in command loops - move forward when commands hang
- Use `dir` instead of `ls` for directory listing in PowerShell

## Proactive Problem Solving
- Don't wait for user input when the next step is obvious
- Check current state first before asking questions
- If I see a remote is already set up correctly, proceed with the next step
- Be decisive rather than getting stuck waiting
- When git says "working tree clean", that means everything is committed and pushed

## PowerShell/Windows Environment Awareness
- Be aware of PowerShell's screen reader compatibility warnings
- Some commands may hang due to PowerShell's behavior
- Use Windows-compatible commands (`dir` vs `ls`)
- Don't assume Unix/Linux command behavior
- Command behavior differs from Unix/Linux
- Some git commands may hang indefinitely
- Use Windows-compatible alternatives
- Be patient with PowerShell responses
- Consider command alternatives when stuck

## User Preference Memory
- User prefers optimizing for features over performance
- User values self-documenting code and systems
- User appreciates proactive problem-solving
- User wants me to learn from mistakes and update rules accordingly
- User expects me to find ways to update cursor rules when possible
- User wants me to be more decisive and proactive
- User expects me to learn from mistakes
- User values efficiency and not getting stuck
- User wants self-documenting improvements
- User expects me to find ways to update my own rules

## Error Handling Patterns
- Port conflicts: Change port numbers in configuration
- Missing modules: Create missing files systematically
- OpenAI model access: Use available models (gpt-3.5rbo)
- JSON serialization: Convert datetime objects to strings
- Streamlit command not found: Use `python -m streamlit run`

## Learning and Rule Update Process
- Search for available tools or methods to update cursor rules
- If direct method not found, create comprehensive documentation
- Document learnings in a structured format
- Provide actionable improvements for future interactions
- Acknowledge the learning and show how to apply it

## Communication Best Practices
- Acknowledge the issue immediately when getting stuck
- Explain what I learned from the experience
- Provide specific solutions for future similar situations
- Dont repeat the same mistake
- Show proactive problem-solving

## Immediate Behavior Changes
1. **Git Command Strategy**: Always start with simple git commands, avoid complex ones that can hang
2. **Proactive Behavior**: When next step is obvious, proceed without waiting
3. **PowerShell Awareness**: Use Windows-compatible commands and expect different behavior
4. **Error Recovery**: When commands hang, try alternative approaches immediately
5. **Learning Documentation**: Create structured learning notes when user requests rule updates

## Long-term Improvements
1. **Command Alternatives**: Always have backup commands ready
2. **Environment Detection**: Adapt behavior based on detected environment (Windows vs Unix)
3. **User Preference Memory**: Remember and apply user preferences consistently
4. **Self-Improvement**: Actively seek ways to update rules and learn from interactions
5. **Efficiency Focus**: Prioritize getting things done over perfect solutions

- **Update Rules**: Incorporate new learnings into this file during the session
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring issues and add them to rules
- **User Preference Tracking**: Record and apply user preferences automatically
- **Error Prevention**: Add rules to prevent repeated mistakes

### Learning Triggers
- User says "you got stuck" or similar feedback
- User provides corrections or improvements
- User requests rule updates
- User expresses preferences or frustrations
- Commands fail or hang repeatedly
- User asks for different approaches
- Successful implementation of complex features
- System integration challenges

2. **Rule Integration**: Add to appropriate section in .cursorrules
3. **Pattern Analysis**: Look for similar issues to prevent recurrence
4. **Proactive Application**: Apply new rules immediately in current session
5. **User Confirmation**: Confirm understanding of new learning

### Continuous Improvement
- Review and refine rules after each session
- Remove outdated or ineffective rules
- Consolidate similar rules for clarity
- Prioritize rules by frequency of use
- Maintain rule relevance and accuracy

### User Feedback Integration
- Treat all user feedback as learning opportunities
